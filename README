Nginx Upstrem Consistent Balancer
=================================

This is balancer meant to be used in conjuction with memcached_pass. 
It uses the ketama algorithm using md5 for hasing both the server and key.
Confirmed compatible with the libmemcached implementation.

Configuration
-------------

Just add ``consistent`` to the upstream block. If you want to modify the
weights of a server, just add ``weight`` to the server definition.

::
    upstream memcache_cluster {
        consistent;
        server 127.0.0.1:11211;
        server 10.0.1.2:11211;
        server 10.0.1.3:11212;
    }
